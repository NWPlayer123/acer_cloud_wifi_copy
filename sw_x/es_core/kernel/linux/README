How to build and test user-kernel mode esc kernel module (escmod.ko)


The official way to build escmod.ko is to

  cd .../sw_x
  make PRODUCT=linux_km es_core

The above will build against the Ubuntu kernel 2.6.32-21-generic-pae.
If you would like to build against your own kernel, 
add LOCAL_BUILD=1, as in

  cd .../sw_x
  LOCAL_BUILD=1 make PRODUCT=linux_km es_core

The escmod.ko built with LOCAL_BUILD=1 goes into a separate directory,
so you may build both versions of escmod.ko in the same work directory.


The official way to test escmod.ko is to

  cd .../sw_x/tests/es
  make PRODUCT=linux_km default

The test requires you to be able to sudo to root to run some commands.
If you see errors trying to sudo, please check and modify /etc/sudoers (using visudo)
and add

  username ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/insmod, /sbin/rmmod, /bin/chmod

where username should be your username.

If you would like to test escmod.ko built with LOCAL_BUILD=1, 
add LOCAL_BUILD=1, as in

  cd .../sw_x/tests/es
  LOCAL_BUILD=1 make PRODUCT=linux_km default
