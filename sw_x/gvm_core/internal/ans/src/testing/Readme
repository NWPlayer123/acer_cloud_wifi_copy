    This directory contains scripts for running some of the module
tests for the ANS server.

    Your PATH environment variable ($path for csh users) must point to
the currently-supported java binary in /opt/routefree.  Currently,
        $ export PATH=/opt/routefree/java1.6/bin/:$PATH
is correct.  The default java installation often doesn't seem to work
with the jar files from the Acer build.

run-anstest, run-many-ans

        The run-anstest script runs the basic code coverage tests
    for the ANS server once.  The script contains instructions on
    how to set it up, but the run-many-ans script automates some
    of the steps, and runs the test repeatedly, dumping the log to
    /tmp.

        To run either script, you will need to have a source tree
    and build the debug.jar file:

        $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_i/infra/modules/ans
        $ make debug.jar

    You might also need to build the sw_i tree itself.  See the wiki
    for instructions:
        http://intwww.routefree.com/wiki/index.php/Infrastructure_Build_Instructions

    Most of the other scripts in this directory are run against an ANS
cluster.  The cluster needs to have the IAS login checks disabled:
        $ ansManager <ANS cluster DNS> set-cluster login-checks off
To install the ansManager program:
        $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_i/infra/modules/ans
        $ make install
        $ su
        # /sbin/pkinst $BUILDROOT/infra/packages/ans/ans.pkg 
        # exit
The ansManager script will be in
        /opt/broadon/pkgs/ans/bin

    You might need to set the credentials age limit to tell the
server to accept credentials coded into the scripts:
        $ ansManager <ANS cluster DNS> set-cluster credentials-age-limit 4000

    The make-export script creates a java.tar file in your home
directory that can be extracted to run the actual test scripts.
This script also exports the tar file to a test cluster.  You will
need to update it to point to your test cluster, if you have one,
or delete those lines.  The ANS package must be built before running
the make-export script:
        $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_i/infra/modules/ans
        $ make install

    To run the programs:
        $ mkdir ~/java
        $ cd ~/java
        $ tar xvf ../java.tar
The tar image can be extracted to any directory.  Using ~/java is
not required.

    The PATH environment variable needs to point to a supported
version of java, typically in /opt/routefree.  Enter:
        $ which java
to check that the path is correct.

    At this point, you'll need to edit the run-device* and run-back*
scripts to point to your test cluster, and run them.  run-lots can
be used to do repeated runs of the run-device script, and you can
make symbolic links to it to run other files.

    The make-export-java script is harder to use, but installs more scripts.
See the script for more details.
