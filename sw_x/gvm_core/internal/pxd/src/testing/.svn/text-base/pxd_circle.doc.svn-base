    To run the pxd_circle program, you need a live PXD server,
but the debug version of PXD can run without ANS or IAS, so you
don't need those modules or servers.  The pxd_circle program
works around the lack of ANS with reasonable reliability.

    Your PATH environment variable ($path for csh users) must
point to the currently-supported java binary in /opt/routefree.
Currently,
        $ export PATH=/opt/routefree/java1.6/bin/:$PATH
is correct.  The default java installation often doesn't seem to
work with the jar files from the Acer build.

To run against a test server on your local machine, build the
server debug jar:

    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_i/infra/modules/pxd
    $ make debug.jar

Then start the PXD server as root:
    # /opt/init.d/S41svcdrv stop
    # cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src/testing
    # ./start-debug
You might need to kill some http demons by hand to free up
TCP port 443.
    # ps -ef | grep httpd
will show the processes.

The server log will in
    /tmp/server.log

Displaying the log on the screen directly can slow the server down
noticeably, so you'll need to run tail -f to watch it.

Then you will need to build the pxd_circle program.
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x
    $ export DEBUG=1
    $ export PRODUCT=linux
    $ make libpxd
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src
    $ make pxd_circle

After that, you can run the pxd_circle program:

    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src/testing
    $ ./run-circle

Once the demon has been started, you can run the pxd_circle test
in a loop with:

    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src/testing
    $ ./run-circle-lots

If you wish to test against a standard PXD demon, one that
uses ANS and IAS, run:
     # ./start-real
instead of
     # ./start-debug
The pxd_circle program does not use or depend on a working
ANS server, but it should function with one running.

If you are running pxd_circle against a real server, the
"ans_host" parameter needs to point to a live ANS server,
or the test will fail when the ANS message queue in the
PXD server overflows.
