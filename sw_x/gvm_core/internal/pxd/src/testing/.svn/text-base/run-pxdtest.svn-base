#  This script runs the PXD module tests and single-instance integration
#  test on a Linux platform.
#
#  You need some jars to run this script.  All the jars should be placed in
#  the $jars directory where this script will be run.  At this point, $jars
#  points to ./jars-unit by default.
#
#  The debug.jar file contains the PXD classes and some debugging skeleton
#  classes.  It is created by running "make debug.jar" in the
#      $WORKAREA/sw_i/infra/modules/pxd
#  directory.  The debug.jar file is put in
#      $BUILDROOT/infra/modules/pxd/debug
#  by the makefile.
#
#  The test requires one additional jar:
#      $BUILDROOT/infra/imports/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
#  The sw_i/infra build should install it in the $BUILDROOT area.
#
#  If your $WORKAREA variable is not set, you also need to install some
#  configuration files:
#      $WORKAREA/sw_i/infra/modules/src/java/com/broadon/pxd/server_keys
#  You'll need to modify this script to point at the configuration files.
#
#  The PATH shell variable needs to point to the version of java that you
#  wish to use.

#
#  Copy the test configuration files to the current directory for the module
#  tests.  The PXD server reads the environment variables, but the module tests
#  do not, so the files need to be in both places.  Also, this approach saves
#  the configuration files locally in case there's a problem.
