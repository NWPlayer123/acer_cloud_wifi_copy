   This directory contains the source and some module tests for
the PXD client library.  The tests run on Linux, and possibly
some other POSIX systems.

   To do the basic setup and run the module tests, you'll need
to set the PRODUCT environment variable.  "linux" works.
The WORKAREA variable must be set, and you'll need the sw_x,
sw_i, and sw_c trees.  Then,
   make all
should work.

   To set up the tests, you need to make various libraries in
the sw_x directory that the tests use.  The easiest way to
do that is to run:
    $ export DEBUG=1
    $ export PRODUCT=linux
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x
    $ make libpxd libans es_core vplex vpl
The "setup" target in the Makefile also will build the libpxd
files and the PXD java code.

If your machine does not have valgrind installed, run:
    # yum install valgrind
as root.  On Ubuntu machines, use:
    # apt-get valgrind

To run the basic stand-alone module tests, enter:
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src
    $ make test
Once the tests have been built, you can run them repeatedly:
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src/testing
    $ ./run-lots
The script will stop when an error is detected.

You can run
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src
    $ make gcov
to get code coverage information for the module tests.
The output is put in the "total" subdirectory.

   To run the pxd_circle test, which runs against a test
version of the PXD demon, see the pxd_circle.doc file in
the ./testing subdirectory.  The pxd_triangle program can
run against a test lab environment.  The pxd_triangle.doc
file in the testing subdirectory describes how to run it.

To make the pxd_circle program, run:
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src
    $ make pxd_circle

To make pxd_triangle, run:
    $ cd $WORKAREA/sw_x/gvm_core/internal/pxd/src
    $ make pxd_triangle

You only need to do the "make libpxd" step once for a new
build area, and then whenever you want a newer version of
the libraries, for example, after running "svn update".

The testing subdirectory also has two scripts for running
the PXD server unit test.  See the run-pxdtest.doc file for
details.
