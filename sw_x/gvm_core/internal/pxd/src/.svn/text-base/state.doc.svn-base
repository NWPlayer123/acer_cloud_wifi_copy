This documents shows the connection and packet flow for each
pxd_client library routine that communicates with a PXD server.
"<-" denotes a packet received by the PXD client (either a
client CCD or a server CCD).  "->" denotes a packet going to
the PXD demon.

If there are two packet types for a single arrow, either might
be sent.  For example:
    <- Send_pxd_response
       Reject_pxd_credentials
means that the packet might get either Send_pxd_response or
Reject_pxd_credentials as a response.

pxd_open
    .  connect to the PXD server
    <- Send_pxd_challenge
    -> Send_pxd_login
    <- Send_pxd_response
       Reject_pxd_credentials

pxd_declare
    -> Declare_server
    <- Send_pxd_response

pxd_lookup
    -> Query_server_declaration
    <- Send_server_declaration
       Send_pxd_response

pxd_connect
    -> Start_connection_attempt
    <- Send_pxd_response
       *** Once this packet is sent, switch to the mirror horde
    <- Send_ccd_challenge
    -> Send_ccd_login
    <- Reject_ccd_credentials
       Send_ccd_response

pxd_receive
    <- ANS pxd_connect_request
    .  connect to the PXD server
    <- Send_pxd_challenge
    -> Send_pxd_login
    <- Reject_pxd_credentials
       Send_pxd_response
    -> Start_proxy_connection
    <- Send_pxd_response
       *** Once this packet is sent, switch to the mirror horde
    -> Send_ccd_challenge
    <- Send_ccd_login
    -> Reject_ccd_credentials
       Send_ccd_response
