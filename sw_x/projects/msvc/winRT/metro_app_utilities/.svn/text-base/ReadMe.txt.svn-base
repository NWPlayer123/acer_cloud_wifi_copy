    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the

    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project
