How to create a Windows Installer package file for SyncAgent


- You will need to be on a Windows PC.
- You will need to have WiX version 3.5 installed.
- You will need to have the following environment variables defined:
-- PBROOT, the absolute path to the part of the build root for win32_ul.
-- SRCROOT, the absolute path to the sw_x directory.
-- VERSION, the version number for the package file.  It must have exactly 3 components separated by a dot in the form major.minor.build.


To generate the msi files, run make.
(makemsi.bat is now obsolete)



Right now, self-registering the shell extension is a little tricky.
The shell extension depends on the CRT and ATL DLLs included in the installer package,
which won't be committed/available until InstallFinalize.
However, to run a custom action with elevated privileges, 
it must be done before InstallFinalize.
Thus, the current solution is to spawn register.exe as a background process
and have it periodically try to register the shell extension.

register.exe is a compiled AutoIt script.
It is compiled for x86 as a console application.
